Since then my love and interest in technology keep growing, I start study front-end to expand my skills in 2016, since then I can create fluid and responsive interfaces. Recently  (2019) I lead a dev team in one FinTech, expanding my knowledge about agile methodology, collaboration, and project organization. Now I'm improving my code skills in the javascript server-side, like ReactJS, and excited to know about my next challenge.",
